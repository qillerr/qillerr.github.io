# MeX
More readable ascii mathematics - converting straight to LaTeX  

Kind of a demo but it's very much usable!  
Now the parser/replacer is not in any way SOTA, or even good, but it's very easy to tune to your needs


Most useful when quick-typing fractions or reasonably non-complex mathematical expressions.


### TODO when I have time and initiative:  
Move `<script>` dependencies into package dependencies
Top-panel with insertables (like in wysiwyg editors)  
For efficiency hard split of MeX code on double newlines (for example with hr) - it'd look nice and increase speed  
Make right panel follow left panel and the other way around as well. //Like in markdown editor for vs code  

Distant todo: maybe find a latex beautifier??
